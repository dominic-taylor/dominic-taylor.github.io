    <h4> Time and Habits </h4>
    
<p>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? I read all the articles/watched the videos in the resources, and I have used the timeboxing technique. I'm also fond of going for a walk with no particular destination to chill out for a bit. 
                                                    </p>


<p>
What did you find interesting? 
I liked the idea of forming a habit by taking an action and chunking it into a small achievable activity. I was interested in the idea of group flow where a team is "in the zone" because it seems like it would be a great way to get things done, and I've always thought of the flow concept as being a solitary experience. 
        </p>

<p>
What worked for you?
I haven't had the opportunity to use much at this stage, but what didn't work for me was splitting my toggl timers into concepts or assignments, as I usually read a little of the resources, then do a little of the assignment and it didn't seem worth it to make seperate timers. 
                                      </p>

<p>
Which will you experiment further with? For the future I will remember the starting small and Minimal Viable Product concepts, as sometimes I have an idea I don't finish, (or even start) because it is quite big, and in my head I'm thinking of the time it will take to finish the whole thing, rather then an aspect I could complete and actually get some progress on. 
                                              </p>
