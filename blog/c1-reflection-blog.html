    <p>
      What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?
I think it is very well put together. I like the focus on things other than coding and the staff I have met seem very genuine and committed. </p>
<p>
What are your impressions?
The two thoughts that come to mind, is caring and intense.
</p>

<p>
How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
I can seem myself really enjoying it but also at the same time I like my own time so being around a lot of outgoing people could be a challenge. </p>

<p>
Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
To be honest my expectations haven't changed that much. I am pretty cautious and really research a lot, before I have to commit to something requiring the investment of EDA. That being said it's the first week! I'm prepared to be surprised. </p>
<p>
Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
I'm very excited! I see it as a chance push myself and learn a whole new skill that will serve me well.
