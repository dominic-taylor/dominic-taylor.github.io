             <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h4>  
             <p>A responsive site is one where the look of the webpage changes depending on the type of device it is viewed on. For example a page may become simpler and more important information easier to navigate to, when viewed on a mobile phone screen, in order to make it quicker to load and use on a smaller and less powerful device.</p>

It is important as more and more people view web sites on mobile devices, but as developers we have generally looked at the internet on desktop computers. This approach also makes pages easier for less powerful devices to load as they don't have to parse a whole lot of code to make a page fit it's screen.  </p>

<p> A framework is prewritten code for websites, for example buttons, forms and layouts. The pros are, it is quicker to develop a webpage using prewritten code, and pages can be consistent across browsers. Cons include having to learn a new framework could take time, and becoming over reliant on a framework, rather than learning how to do things yourself.  </p>

Every element on a page like an image, link or paragraph is contained within a box which defines its' parameters. There are different parts of the box model, which from the inside-out are; </p>
