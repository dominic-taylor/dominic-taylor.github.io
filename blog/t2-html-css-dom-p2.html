<h4>Udacity Reflection Part II</h4>  

<h4>What is grid based design? </h4>
<p> Grid based design is how many, if not all webpages, are layed out. From the design side a page is divided into a grid of rectangles of varying size in which is put content. Code-wise, this is acheviced by creating a row class which spans the width of the page, and 12 column classes, each spanning 1/12th of the width. 12 is chosen as these can be used to make a grid with divisons which can handle different dimensions more easily.  </p>


 <h4>  Whats all the hype about responsive webpages? </h4>
<p> People view the internet on computers and devices with varying screen size or resolution, and responsive webpages are a way to ensure websites look good on all of them.   </p>

<h4>Semantic structure</h4>
<p> Semantic structure refers to how code is written, specifically its' clarity and readabilty. Code with good semantic structure should allow a developer to have a pretty good idea of how it will look as a webpage without opening it in a browser. This can be done by using tags that describe the meangin of an element, such as < img >, < main >, or < nav >, rather than just < div > or < span >.  </p>
